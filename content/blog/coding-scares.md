Coding Scares me alot

I got scared{" "}when i have to code something unknown,  I got scared{" "}when no one is coding in that language which isassigned to me,  I got scared{" "}when i get list of m0thâ‚¬rf@king bugs in my project,and{" "}  don't know hove to solve them, And the greatest thing is that no one around mylocal scope is coding that thing.{" "}  So i have to figure out the solution alone in any  condition{" "}otherwise i'm gonna fired. I got scared...

But each time i find the right solution, the pleasureit gives me insane, Fixing bugs{" "}  increases circulation of blood in my vains, When i read documentation, scrape the internet andfix things{" "}  it puts my confidence to f@king another level.
