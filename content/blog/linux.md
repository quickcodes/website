Windows 10 is a free upgrade, if you don't value your privacy.

The Linux philosophy is 'Laugh in the face of danger'. Ops. Wrong One. 'Do it Yourself'. Yes that's it.

Linux is a flavor of UNIX, and as a first approximation all user commands under UNIX work precisely the same under Linux (and FreeBSD and lots of other UNIX-like systems).

Under Linux there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you can point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done without first reading lots of documentation. The traditional UNIX environment is a CLI (command line interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what to do. That is faster and more powerful, but requires finding out what the commands are.
