<h2 id="you-think-your-independent-but-you-are-not">You think your independent, but you are not.</h2>
<p>Everyone now days carries a cell phones with them even small childs, And it's important right?</p>
<p>It is good to have a cell phone, it connect's us with the outer world, makes our life easier, happier, makes us more productive etc... But here is the thing, Yes it have plenty of advantages but the list of the disadvantages a normie don't know is far far more bigger than you expected... the more you are using cell phones and internet the more stupid, boring and annoying you are becoming and let us just talk about it more.</p>
<p>We all know all the big tech companies provides their services for almost free like google, youtube etc. but just think about it they are billion dollar's tech companies they don't even need to earn from you directly, they have alot of different ways to earn. And the biggest reason why their services are free is because they are giving shape to your life, to your thoughts. Agree or not but they are controlling your life. They have created Big Computer models which serves you the thing you want.</p>
<p>They have created anti-patterns to make you less of a person lets be real. And if i talk about cell phones, it is just crazy because they are computers. The most personal type of computer you have, And you put all your email on it, all your login information's on different websites, and it has most of your sensitive information's and data. but at the same time it is a computer you have a least amount of control on. I mean you don't even have root access to it. ya you can do root your device but it's different case. You even can't uninstall default applications comes with your cell phone brand which no one even uses. All the applications that data mines you to give your life a shape they want.</p>
<p>You don't really have authority to get rid of them or really tell them what to do, what not to do.</p>
<p>You think you have the access to your phone because it's your personal device but in reality you don't really have permissions to change it, google does or apple does they have permissions to do anything with your personal device to make a your life better in their wording or to make a world better place.</p>
<p>I know you have alot of things you do with your cell phones and you think they are usefull like sending daily snaps, or posting stories on instagram, or scrolling those 30 sec videos like reels or shorts. you think they are refreshing your mind, giving you smile but in reality they are not, For them you are just a model for their AI. they even know how many seconds you watch a reel/post/story and according to them their AI starts showing things to you. and increases your screen time.</p>
<p>we think they are usefull but when you really take them away you will realise that you don't actually loose that much at all. People will have all their notifications turned on from all the apps they have which looks horrable. They keeps all those apps like instagram, snapchat, youtube, twitter on their finger tips so they don't miss anything. Makes them fell like it is something not replacable but when you go without your phone in life which i did many times, you feel more free, you feel more mentally relaxed and stuff like that.</p>
<p>ya i can understand if you have a business phone but then keep it for just business purposes and not give them access to control you, that's what i'm trying to say. I very much encourage people to less use cell phones or stuff like that for those reasons.</p>
<p>There is a reflex that people develop when they have cell phones, myself included. for example when you 10 seconds alone and you don't have anything to do. Your mind with unlimited possibilities will not give some free mental time to yourself but it will follow that reflex to pull out phone from your pocket and see what people are doing on social media, or ohh i got received a notification from instagram in my class let me check out what is that, or maybe yor check your instagram feed or whatever and you don't really get into that but you really lossed something. you loosed mental freedom. you loosed your mental ability to think another stuff in your small free time. Only because of the screen time you are constantly spending on your cell phones. And it does changes your personality.</p>
<p>Yes i have a cell phone they are nice they have camera, they gives us functionality to make contact with other peoples, we can record any moment. Cell phones can be usefull. But only use them when you needed.</p>
<p>And it is not really about cell phones but all the websites we use are full of shits they are bloated, slow and tracking everything they can. A normal websites tooks almost 10x time to load and consumes alot more data than needed only because of their adds, trackers or that kind of stuff. and that is one of the reason why i made this website simple.</p>
